## **ðŸŽ¯ BUSINESS PROBLEM DEFINITION**

### **Primary Problem Statement**
**"Build a predictive system that forecasts hourly taxi demand by NYC zone using weather and air quality conditions to optimize driver allocation and reduce passenger wait times during weather events."**

### **Business Context**
- **Pain Point**: Taxi demand surges 50-200% during rain/snow, leading to passenger frustration and lost revenue
- **Opportunity**: Weather forecasts are available 7 days ahead - we can predict demand spikes before they happen
- **Business Value**: Better driver allocation â†’ reduced wait times â†’ increased customer satisfaction + revenue
